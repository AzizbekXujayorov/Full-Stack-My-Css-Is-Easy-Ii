# Welcome to My Css Is Easy Ii

## Task
Create a HTML page with CSS styling using Bootstrap 4, Bootstrap 5, or Tailwind CSS. Ensure the HTML file is named "index.html" and the CSS file is named "style.css".

## Description
My task is to replicate a specific scheme using HTML and CSS. This scheme includes various elements and styling directives to follow. I should utilize either Bootstrap 4, Bootstrap 5, or Tailwind CSS for this project. Avoid using floats in your layout as they are discouraged for this exercise.

Bootstrap provides a robust grid system and a wide range of built-in classes. Familiarize with the grid system and explore Bootstrap's built-in classes before adding custom styles. 

Bootstrap 4 or Bootstrap 5 documentation for understanding its grid system and built-in classes.
CSS tutorials for additional guidance.

## Installation
No specific installation steps are required for this project. Simply create a folder for the project and ensure it contains the necessary files: "index.html" and "style.css".

## Usage
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
Open the "index.html" file in a web browser to view the replicated scheme.
Optionally, you can modify the HTML and CSS files to experiment with different styles or layouts.
Remember to adhere to the provided guidelines and replicate the scheme as accurately as possible.
